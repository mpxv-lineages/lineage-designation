# Designation of three B.1 sublineages 

Sequence submissions have slowed down with an ebbing outbreak. Nonetheless, recent sequence uploads cluster in hitherto undesignated lineages that are hereby designated as **B.1.15, B.1.16 and B.1.17**.

The criteria used to designate these lineages are the same as previously, and are based on genomes available in INSDC databases and:

- International spread
- Having at least 1 mutation above the parent lineage
- Containing at least 15 sequences or plausibly represents undersampled diversity
- Clear common phylogenetic structure (no uncertainty about possibly being designated as 2 lineages instead of 1)
- Has at least one freely available high quality reference sequence

#### B.1.15

At date of designation, this is a mostly Colombian lineage with additional circulation in Germany and Portugal. It is defined by the ncleotide SNPs `G149818A` and `G151362A`.
At date of designation, the cluster is comprised of around 20 sequences.
This lineage was externally proposed by @ha-ruiz75 in [issue 30](https://github.com/mpxv-lineages/lineage-designation/issues/30).
The `yaml` file can be found [here](../lineages/B.1.15.yml).

#### B.1.16

At date of designation, this is a mostly Colombian lineage with some circulation in the UK.
It is defined by three SNPs: `C9389T`, `G161797A`, `A185557C`. At date of designation, the cluster is comprised of around 20 sequences.
This lineage was externally proposed by @ha-ruiz75 in [issue 30](https://github.com/mpxv-lineages/lineage-designation/issues/30).
The `yaml` file can be found [here](../lineages/B.1.16.yml).

#### B.1.17

At date of designation, this is an exclusively US lineage, with sequences from the US states of California and Washington.
This lineage is defined by two SNPs: `12169A` and `44960A`.
This lineage was internally proposed.
The `yaml` file can be found [here](../lineages/B.1.17.yml).
