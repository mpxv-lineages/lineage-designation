# Designation of two B.1 sublineages and one C.1 sublineage

Transmission of descendants of the 2022 outbreak lineage B.1 is ongoing in 2023 and 2024. Most of the sequenced genomes fall within one of 4 lineages, 3 of which are newly designated here: B.1.21, B.1.22, C.1.1, while B.1.20 is a previously designated lineage. With these designations.

All of the 3 lineages satisfy the criteria for lineage designation last updated in October 2023:

- International spread
- Having at least 2 mutation above the parent lineage (increased from 1)
- Containing at least 15 sequences or plausibly represents undersampled diversity
- Clear common phylogenetic structure (no uncertainty about possibly being designated as 2 lineages instead of 1)
- Has at least one freely available high quality reference sequence

#### B.1.21

This is a mostly cross-US lineage with the most recent sequence collected in February 2024.

It is defined by `G22415A` and `C132698T`.
The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/B.1.21.yml).

#### B.1.22

This is a mostly German lineage with the most recent sequence collected in March 2024.

It is defined by `C34784T` and `C101418T`.
The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/B.1.22.yml).

#### C.1.1 (alias of B.1.3.1.1)

This is a global lineage with the most recent sequence collected in March 2024. It was sequenced particularly frequently in Portugal, but also in Germany and the US - which are the major sequencing countries that submit to the INSDC. GISAID-only sequences indicate this lineage was common in China.

It is defined by `C21062T` and `C149963T`.
The `yaml` file can be found [here](../lineages/C.1.1.yml).
