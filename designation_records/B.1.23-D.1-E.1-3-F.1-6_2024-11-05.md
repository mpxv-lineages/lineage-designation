# Designation of multiple B.1 sublineages, including deep aliases

Transmission of descendants of the 2022 outbreak lineage B.1 is ongoing in 2024. The new lineage designations aim to capture current circulation (since July 2024), most of which has been concentrated into B.1.20 and C.1.1 - at least based on publicly available genomes which are predominantly from the US, Germany, Portugal, and Australia.

The newly designated lineages are B.1.23; D.1 (B.1.6.1); E.1, E.2, E.3 (all children of C.1.1); and F.1, F.2, F.3, F.4, F.5, and F.6 (children of B.1.20). With these designations, the B.1 descendants are more clearly distinguished from each other.

All of the 11 lineages satisfy the criteria for lineage designation last updated in October 2023:

- International spread
- Having at least 2 mutation above the parent lineage (increased from 1)
- Containing at least 15 sequences or plausibly represents undersampled diversity
- Clear common phylogenetic structure (no uncertainty about possibly being designated as 2 lineages instead of 1)
- Has at least one freely available high quality reference sequence

#### B.1.23

This lineage is a close sibling of B.1.20 and has been first sequenced in 2024, in Germany, Portugal and the US.

The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/B.1.23.yml).

#### D.1 (alias of B.1.6.1)

This is a predominantly South American lineage with public samples being available from Europe and North America. It was proposed for designation by the Peruvian Genomic Surveillance team of the Instituto Nacional de Salud in <https://github.com/mpxv-lineages/lineage-designation/issues/41>.

The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/D.1.yml).

#### E.1 (alias of C.1.1.1)

This descendant of C.1.1 has been sequenced in Portugal, Germany, and the US.

The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/E.1.yml).

#### E.2 (alias of C.1.1.2)

This descendant of C.1.1 has been sequenced in Portugal, Germany, Ireland, and the US.

The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/E.2.yml).

#### E.3 (alias of C.1.1.3)

This descendant of C.1.1 has been sequenced in Portugal, Germany, Australia, and the US.

The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/E.3.yml).

#### F.1 (alias of B.1.20.1)

Like most of B.1.20 and its descendants, this lineage is predominantly found in the US, but has also been sequenced in Germany and Australia.

This lineage was proposed by Ammar Aziz of the Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in <https://github.com/mpxv-lineages/lineage-designation/issues/40>.

The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/F.1.yml).

#### F.2 (alias of B.1.20.2)

This B.1.20 sublineage is particularly common in the US and Australia, but was also sequenced in Germany.

This lineage was proposed by Ammar Aziz of the Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in <https://github.com/mpxv-lineages/lineage-designation/issues/39>.

The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/F.2.yml).

#### F.3 (alias of B.1.20.3)

This B.1.20 sublineage is predominantly found in the US, but has also been sequenced in Germany.

The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/F.3.yml).

#### F.4 (alias of B.1.20.4)

This B.1.20 sublineage has been sequenced in the US, Germany and Portugal.

The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/F.4.yml).

#### F.5 (alias of B.1.20.5)

This B.1.20 sublineage has been sequenced in the US, Germany and Portugal.

The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/F.5.yml).

#### F.6 (alias of B.1.20.6)

This B.1.20 sublineage has been sequenced in the US and Germany.

The yaml file can be found [here](../lineages/F.6.yml).
